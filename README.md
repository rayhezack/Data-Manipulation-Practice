# Data-Manipulation-Practice

Pandas and Numpy are the two core packages for a data analyst. Of the two packages, Pandas is the primary package for us to manipulate dataset when doing data analytics job, such as indexing, sorting, aggregation, transforming, and so on.

The primary objective of this repository is to enhance data manipulation skills by solving SQL quesitons from Leetcode with Python. 

*Note: my suggesiton is that this methodology works well for people who have mastered high skills of SQl and want to improve their corresponding skills of python.*
